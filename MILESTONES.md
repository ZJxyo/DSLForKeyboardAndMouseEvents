# Milestone 1
DSL Description:<br/>
A script for abstracting programmable/automatic mouse clicks and keystrokes/macros. 

Target user:
- PC users
- Game cheat
- Any program requiring constant user activity
- Software sequence for boot up
- Password manager 

Feature list:
- Selectable coordinates for mouse action
- Programmable keystrokes
- Combination of various keyboard/mouse actions
- Repeating activities (Loops)
- Creating programmable macros
- Inserting time intervals between actions
- Held down key actions

Examples:
- Clicks the F5 key to refresh every 300 ms<br/>
Loop 5 times { <br/>
Click key F5 <br/>
Wait 300<br/>
}<br/>
- Dragging mouse to position x, y<br/>
Hold left key <br/>
Release left key at (x, y)<br/>
- Automatically typing a string<br/>
Click qwerty<br/>
- Combination keys<br/>
Combo control, alt, delete <br/>
Click key tab key alt<br/>


TA FeedBack:<br/>
Good idea that can be fleshed out because of the different keystroke and mouse click combinations that can be formed.<br/>
Current design has sufficient complexity. It is important to define a proper scope for the DSL project.<br/>

Planned Tasks/Features to design:
- Finalize DSL format/grammar
- Examine the difficulty of feature implementation
- Find user study candidates

## User Study

### Activity 1:
Select all at 200, 300, copy, then paste at 1200, 300

Program: Command;
Command: mouse

Mouse : ‘press’ ’91 ‘,’ 65’   
‘at’ ‘200’,’300’;  
Mouse : release ‘1200 ‘.’ 300’;


- The user got confused on when to hover, vs press, vs release.
- He did not understand what input meant.
- He did not know that "|" meant an OR operator.
- Did not know how the coordinates work on screen (so didn't understand that 0,0 is top left) although not necessarily needed to code in the activities.
- Did not complain about needing to calculate the key code, however would make the code more readable if we used the actual keys instead of int values.
- User did not understand when to click.
- User did not understand that the 'press' key word is consecutive for consecutive presses. He thought that you can press multiple keys at once, however for that functionality we use hold.

### Comments during the coding
- "I don't know how to code so I don't fully understand the example"
- "I'm not sure where I am supposed to start. Do we write out "program" or not?"
- "How am I supposed to input multiple key presses at once?"
- "I must be an idiot for not being able to figure this out"

After this example we walked through the grammar with him and explained the details to him. We went through the solution and then gave him the next example to try (which was far more difficult than the first example).


### Activity 2:
Search file name “testfile.txt” in file explorer in the downloads folder, delete the file, then close the window (windows shortcuts: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec):

Hold 91  
Press 69  
Release 91  
Hold 18  
Press 68  
Release 18  
Input Downloads  
Press 13  
Hold 17  
Press 69  
Release 17  
Input testfile.txt  
Press 13  
Hold 17  
Press 65  
Release 17  
Press 46  
Hold 17  
Press 87  
Release 17


### Comments during the coding:
- “My computer doesn't have a windows key, how should I type that”
- “This is such a grind to open these many tabs to write this out” (referring to opening windows shortcut
- “I kind of wish I could visually see what was happening” (mac user not used to windows)
- “What's the difference between an address box and search box?” (confusion in windows shortcut site)
- “Wait what if there are multiple test files?”
- “How do I select a folder inside here? I could do tab, or select all, but I might delete the wrong files”

User got confused as to what he did earlier, because its hard to read the numbers and understand what you did earlier - either need comments in our language as well or have option for user to type out specific key


Possible Sources of Confusion (Design Principles Reflection):
Efficiency: The time it takes to do the simple tasks by coding is not ideal since it is simpler to do it manually. The examples we gave to the user were examples of things that are better done without programming, and that made the experience a bit frustrating since you are adding much more effort into something that doesn't need it. However for tasks that require a lot of repetition our language is good for, so it does not violate the efficiency design principal.

Simplicity: Our program only has a small number of key words so is generally simple. The user studies validated that for us. 

# Milestone 4<br/>
## Problems found during user study/ TA meeting
Q: What is the input command?      
A: Changed to write for clarity, meant to type a string to a text box<br/>
Q: Keycodes are unfriendly to users.        <br/>
A: Use key names<br/>
Q: Hold and release can be merged.        <br/>
A: Merged for readability but now it becomes less flexible<br/>
Q: Hold inside Repeat or vice versa       <br/>
A: Adjusted parser to make this work<br/>
Q: The use case of this DSL was unclear      <br/>
A: Focus on making it a cheat engine that can grind games automatically, but also with other functionalities<br/>
<br/>

## Changes
- Input -> Write<br/>
- Keycode -> Key name<br/>
- Made hover a separate command<br/>
- Merged Hold and Release into a block<br/>
- Changed the way repeat and hold wrap commands<br/>
<br/>
Problem with the new lexer/parser: Every number input field has to be TEXT or else antlr always recognize the TEXT after commas as a NUM. Need to convert to int.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## New Lexer
lexer grammar firstLexer ;<br/>
<br/>
REPEAT_START: ('Repeat' | 'repeat') WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE);<br/>
TIMES: 'times' ;<br/>
LEFT_BRACKET: '{' ;<br/>
RIGHT_BRACKET: '}' ;<br/>
WAIT: ('Wait' | 'wait') WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE) ;<br/>
AT: 'at' WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE) ;<br/>
PRESS: ('Press' | 'press') WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE) ;<br/>
HOLD_START: ('Hold' | 'hold') WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE) ;<br/>
WRITE: ('Write' | 'write') WS -> mode(STRING_MODE) ;<br/>
HOVER: 'Hover' | 'hover' ;<br/>
<br/>
COMMA: ',' WS* -> mode(TEXT_MODE) ;<br/>
WS : [\r\n\t ]+ -> channel(HIDDEN) ;<br/>
<br/>
mode TEXT_MODE ;<br/>
TEXT: [a-zA-Z0-9]+ -> mode(DEFAULT_MODE) ;<br/>
<br/>
mode STRING_MODE ;<br/>
STRING: ~[\r\n]+ -> mode(DEFAULT_MODE) ;<br/>
<br/>

## New Parser
parser grammar firstParser;<br/>
options { tokenVocab = firstLexer; }<br/>
<br/>
program : code+ ;<br/>
code : command | repeat | hold;<br/>
repeat : REPEAT_START TEXT TIMES LEFT_BRACKET code+ RIGHT_BRACKET ;<br/>
hold : HOLD_START keys mouse? LEFT_BRACKET code+ RIGHT_BRACKET ;<br/>
command : waitFor | press | hover | write;<br/>
waitFor : WAIT TEXT ;<br/>
press : PRESS keys mouse? ;<br/>
hover : HOVER mouse ;<br/>
write: WRITE STRING ;<br/>
<br/>
mouse : AT coord ;<br/>
coord : TEXT COMMA TEXT ;<br/>
keys : TEXT (COMMA TEXT)* ;<br/>


## Status of implementation

The DSL program is functional, however we have yet to find an efficient way to print out characters including special symbols without using copy and paste. Since copy paste doesn't work across operating systems (for example Mac also has control, but uses command + c to copy instead of control), this feature might need to be revised.

Additionally, “Press” currently only reads in keycodes, but we are planning to change it to accept text, so that it is more user friendly. In addition, variables and basic arithmetic on those variables will be added to allow users to make more advanced scripts.


## Plans for final user study
For the first user study, we noticed that the participant was not familiar enough with computational thinking to break down operation steps easily. For the final user study, we are considering narrowing down the pool of potential users/the target audience. The user study will be conducted after we complete a few more user oriented features (to improve usability). We are planning to use the same activities as the first user study.



## Timeline for the remaining days
- 10/11 Complete implementation of user friendly features
- 10/11 Augment user study to fit updated features
- 10/13 Conduct final user study
- 10/13 Final revisions and tweaks
- 10/15 Create video

# Milestone 5

## User study
Examples:<br/>
// Press one or more keys in the order specified<br/>
press a, b, c<br/>
// Wait for a fixed amount of time, specified in millisecond<br/>
wait 3000<br/>
// Move your cursor to the screen coordinate specified<br/>
hover at 300, 400<br/>
// Type a string<br/>
Write bankaccountpassword<br/>
// Hold down one or more keys while performing other operations<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press tab<br/>
press c<br/>
press tab<br/>
press v<br/>
}<br/>
// Repeat a set of commands a fixed number of times<br/>
repeat 5 times {<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press tab<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
// Declare a new variable with the name specified<br/>
new ac<br/>
// Assign a value to the variable<br/>
set ac = 20<br/>
// Assign a variable value to another variable<br/>
new bc<br/>
set bc = ac<br/>
// Perform arithmetics on a variable<br/>
\+ ac, 30<br/>
\- ac, bc<br/>
\- 16, 10<br/>
\* ac, 2<br/>
// Print the value of a variable to console, in this case (20 + 30 - 20) * 2 = 60<br/>
print ac<br/>
// Variables can be used in screen coordinates, this is equivalent to 60, 300<br/>
hover at ac, 300<br/>
<br/>

Names for action keys:<br/>
alt, esc, backspace, tab, capslock, enter, shift, control, option, command, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, SpaceBar, windows, left, middle, right, delete<br/>

Activity 1:<br/>

Search file name “testfile.txt” in file explorer in the downloads folder, delete the file, then close the window.<br/>

Shortcuts:<br/>
windows + e to open file explorer<br/>
alt + d to access the address bar of the file explorer window, use this to get into the downloads folder<br/>
control + e to access the search bar of the file explorer window, use this to search for the file<br/>
control + a to select all<br/>
control + w to close a window<br/>

Solution:<br/>
hold windows {<br/>
press e<br/>
}<br/>
hold alt {<br/>
press d<br/>
}<br/>
write downloads<br/>
press enter<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press e<br/>
}<br/>
write testfile.txt<br/>
press enter<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press a<br/>
}<br/>
press delete<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press w<br/>
}<br/>

Activity 2:<br/>
Drag the 10 text files into the folder above them by simulating click & drag with a mouse.<br/>
Hint:<br/>
Start at 200, 345. This is the location of the 10th and last file<br/>
The folder is located at 200, 130<br/>
To emulate dragging a file, windows needs an intermediate movement to recognize the action. For example, do start -> move slightly up or down -> end.<br/>
A solution is moving 21 pixels in between each file<br/>
Loops and variables are recommended<br/>

Solution:<br/>
wait 1000<br/>
new start<br/>
new temp<br/>
set start = 345<br/>
repeat 10 times {<br/>
set temp = start<br/>
hover at 200,start<br/>
hold left {<br/>
\+ temp, 5<br/>
hover at 200, temp<br/>
hover at 200, 130<br/>
\- start, 21<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>

Activity 3:<br/>
With google chrome open, open a new incognito tab with (ctrl+shift+n), search “r ubc”, then click the first link in the search results (tab, then enter twice), to navigate to the ubc subreddit. Now refresh the webpage 5 times every 5 seconds. Lastly, close the window (ctrl+w).<br/>

Hint: Since the operation is specific to chrome, first navigate to the application manually and bring it into focus by a left click (manual as well).  <br/>
<br/>
Solution:<br/>
<br/>
wait 1000<br/>
hold control, shift {<br/>
press n<br/>
}<br/>
write r ubc<br/>
press enter<br/>
press tab<br/>
press enter<br/>
press enter<br/>
repeat 5 times {<br/>
wait 5000<br/>
press F5<br/>
}<br/>
hold control {<br/>
press w<br/>
}<br/>

## User questions regarding language grammar:
- what happens when I write a combination of commands?
- combinations of hold and repeat
- can we set a variable before declaring?
- can variables be used for commands other than hover?
- does uppercase vs lowercase matter when writing a key? 
- why are some key names capitalized and some are not?

## User response during activities: 
Activity 1:
- user referred to the grammar examples couple of times after initial explanation
- user tried to do the commands manually before actually writing the code to better understand the process of operation
- the simple commands were easy to understand, so the user was able to do those easily

Activity 2:
- user was slightly confused about the coordinates due to the row by row nature of this example/activity
- user had to think about how to perform a click action
- user had to think about how to simulate the dragging action
- user realized we can hold the mouse key and hover at different coordinates fairly quickly
- user asked if variable commands be used inside the code blocks of hold/repeat
- user was able to read the commands he wrote at the end and easily step through them again in detail, to make sure the program was written as intended

Activity 3:
-  user had questions regarding the usage of indentations\tabs inside code blocks
- after doing activities 1 and 2, user already had a good grasp of the dsl so this activity was easier
- when trying to load webpages, the user has to take into account the loading speed.


## Reflection:
Overall, the final user study yielded a much more positive response compared to the first user study, which reinforces our conclusions regarding the target audience of our DSL language. While being perfectly learnable/usable for practically all computer users, users with programming experience (or have a deep understanding of computational thinking) and sufficient knowledge of OS operations will have a much easier time adopting our grammar design. 
<br/>
The user was able to read, write, and proofread commands fairly easily after a simple explanation of the language grammar. As such, our DSL language conforms to the principles of simplicity and efficiency. <br/>
Furthermore, during the user study, it became apparent that users will have to account for delays manually if there are any non-instantaneous operations, such as loading a webpage. In terms of design principles, this is related to the principle of security, as untimed delays in between instructions would result in undefined behavior. In other words, the necessity for the manual insertion of “waits” deducts from the usability of our program. However, this fact does not contradict with our goals and design choices, as such dynamic matters are best left for the user to handle on a case by case basis. <br/>
In terms of the principle of expressiveness, the expressiveness of our DSL language was demonstrated by the second activity in this user study. While accomplishing the same goal/task, the user’s solution was distinct from our own. The combination of nested repeats (loops), hold blocks, and variables contributed to the expressiveness of our language.<br/>

## Updates to DSL design:
- Variable functionality was added to the “wait” command.
- A  delay variable was added so that the user can choose a specific delay for each command. The default delay is 300ms.
- See repo for updates to the grammar.

## Status of implementation:
- Complete

## Planned timeline:
- Record the video during the weekend.
